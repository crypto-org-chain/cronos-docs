# IBC (Crypto.org Chain, other Cosmos chains)

## Introduction

![centered image](../assets/webappintro.png)

The Cronos Bridgeâ€™s goal is to support the seamless transfer of assets between blockchains to foster interoperability and for users to enjoy the best DApps and earnings no matter the chain.

The Cronos Bridge (Beta) can be found at [https://cronos.org/bridge](https://cronos.org/bridge)

Cronos Bridge is a fully decentralised protocol built on the open-source projects of [IBC](https://ibcprotocol.org/).

Please read this guide and review the project documentation carefully as misuse may cause the incorrect transfer or even loss of assets. We recommend transferring a small amount first to get yourself acquainted with the Bridge before moving over significant amounts.

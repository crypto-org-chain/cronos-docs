## What is Cronos?

[Cronos](https://cronos.org/) ([cronos.org](http://cronos.org)) is the leading Ethereum-compatible layer 1 blockchain network built on the Cosmos SDK, supported by [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com), [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org) and more than 500 app developers and partners. Today, the #CROfam ecosystem represents an addressable user base of more than 80 million people worldwide. Our mission is to make it easy and safe for the next billion crypto users to adopt Web3, with a focus on decentralized applications in the DeFi, NFTs and GameFi verticals.

Shortly after launch in November 2021, Cronos achieved a top 10 position amongst all chains by TVL. It is home to more than 1 million users and 500+ dApps.

Transaction fees are paid in Cronos ($CRO), a blue chip cryptocurrency.

The Cronos ecosystem is supported by [Cronos Labs](https://cronoslabs.org/), the start-up accelerator of Cronos chain.

## Why build on Cronos?

If you are a Web3 application creator, there are 3 main reasons to build on Cronos:

* EVM compatible – Solidity and all the EVM tools just work out of the box.
* Strategic partnership with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) – easy on-ramp to your dapp.
* \#CROFam - a highly engaged user and builder community of >80 million people worldwide, who are keen to try the latest and greatest apps.&#x20;

As an application founder/developer on Cronos, you can leverage:

* Wrapped versions of most of the world’s top 50 cryptocurrencies
* 30+ leading wallets (including Crypto.com Defi Wallet, MetaMask, Trust Wallet)
* Ethermint, a Ethereum Virtual Machine module built by the open-source Cosmos SDK community.
* IBC cross-chain connectivity to Cosmos chains.
* Convenient Ethereum developer tools (Solidity, Truffle, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, Web3.js, ethers.js, ChainSafe Gaming SDK, etc.).
* [Cronos Play](https://cronos.org/play), a suite of developer tools for web, Unity, Unreal and C++ game developers.

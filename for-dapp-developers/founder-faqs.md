## TLDR; what do I need to know if I am considering Cronos for my dapp?

[Cronos (cronos.org)](https://cronos.org) is the leading Ethereum-compatible layer 1 blockchain network built on the Cosmos SDK, supported by Crypto.com, Crypto.org and more than 500 app developers and partners. Today, the #CROfam ecosystem represents an addressable user base of more than 80 million people worldwide. Our mission is to make it easy and safe for the next billion crypto users to adopt Web3, with a focus on decentralized applications in the DeFi, NFTs and GameFi verticals.

[Cronos Labs](https://cronoslabs.org) can help most dapp creators to enhance the visibility of their product in the Cronos user community. However, Cronos Labs is generally not able to promote token or NFT sales. The following support is available to dapp creators:

* Technical support via [Discord](https://crofam.me/discord) and Telegram.
* Amplification of product launches / feature releases on [social media](https://twitter.com/cronos\_chain) and in the [Cronos newsletter](https://blog.cronos.org).
* Participation in [Cronos video streams / AMAs](https://crofam.me/youtube).
* Project listing at [discover.cronos.org](https://discover.cronos.org) and on various partner platforms (Crypto.com DeFi Wallet, Defillama, Dappradar, etc.).
* [Cronos Builders Program](../cronos-play/unity/play.md) and [Cronos Grants Program](https://cronos.org/grants) (usually for projects who have already started to achieve initial user traction on Cronos).
* [Cronos Accelerator Program](https://cronos.org/accelerators).

## FAQs - ecosystem

**How can I get my project featured at** [**discover.cronos.org**](https://discover.cronos.org)**?**

* Visit [https://discover.cronos.org](https://discover.cronos.org) where you can add your project to the list of Cronos ecosystem projects (click the Submit button).

**How can I get my project featured in the Crypto.com Defi Wallet in-app browser, once deployed on Cronos?**

* Step 1:
  * The first step is to implement login via the Crypto .com Defi Wallet’s SDK, using the DeFiWeb3Connector.
  * See [this tutorial](https://github.com/kentimsit/cronos-wallet-connections) on how to implement wallet connections. The code sample uses [Web3 Wallet](https://web3-wallet.github.io/web3-wallet/docs/getting-started), a wallet connection library used by many Cronos dapps.
  * For more details, you can refer to this repository for documentation and usage: [https://github.com/crypto-com/deficonnect-monorepo/wiki/Chrome-Extension-Wallet-Integration](https://github.com/crypto-com/deficonnect-monorepo/wiki/Chrome-Extension-Wallet-Integration).
  * You cannot proceed to Step 2 until you have checked that your dApp offers a functional connection to the Crypto com DeFi Wallet’s Browser Extension in a desktop browser ([here is the link to the browser extension in the Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptocom-wallet-extensio/hifafgmccdpekplomjjkcfgodnhcellj)).
* Step 2:
  * Complete [this form](https://crypto-com.typeform.com/to/bRvudlYV) to apply to get the URL of your dApp featured in the DeFi Wallet’s dApp ranking tab.
  * The Crypto .com team may need some time to assess the suitability of your dApp and does not provide updates regarding their internal decision making process until there is a positive decision (if any). They may revisit their decisions occasionally, for example a token sale page may not be featured in the Dapp ranking but it may be featured later, once it includes a Dapp with real utility for end-users.
  * Decision criteria include the transparency and security of the dApp, and the quality of the user experience. Therefore, in order to increase your chances of being approved, please ensure that your user-facing website includes a link to your docs and to your Github repository, and that the docs include links to the verified smart contracts on [Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com). You can refer to [this tutorial](https://github.com/kentimsit/cronos-hardhat-boilerplate) on how to deploy your smart contracts to Cronos and verify them on Cronoscan.
* Note: There is currently no process in place to request a token integration with the Crypto.com DeFi Wallet. Token integrations happen once in a while. Meanwhile, your users can import your token manually. See this [Crypto.com help page](https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/5755942-tokens-import) for more information.

**How can I get my project featured in Trust Wallet, once deployed on Cronos?**

* [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/) supports the Cronos mainnet from within the in-app Dapp browser (via the injected Web3 provider) and also via Wallet Connect.
* You can contact the Trust Wallet team to have your Dapp and/or token featured in the Trust Wallet’s mobile Dapp browser. Refer to the [documentation](https://developer.trustwallet.com/listing-guide) for more details.

  * Secondary trading: if you already have a NFT collection live on the Cronos chain and would like to make it allow-listed on the custodial Crypto .com / NFT platform so that the NFT owners can deposit and trade the NFTs at Crypto .com / NFT, please contact Cronos Labs for support ([contact@cronoslabs.org](mailto:contact@cronoslabs.org)) and we will share with you the contractual documents and proof of ownership requirements that are required by Crypto .com.
* Minted NFT platform
  * Minted is a self-custodial NFT platform on Cronos chain and on Ethereum.

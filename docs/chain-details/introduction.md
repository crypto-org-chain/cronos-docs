# Introduction

### Cronos Testnet

Crypto.com introduces the new testnet of Cronos, the Crypto.org EVM compatible chain, on 20 July 2021.

Cronos is the EVM compatible chain running in parallel to the [Crypto.org Chain](https://crypto.org/docs/). It aims to massively scale the Chain DeFi ecosystem, by providing developers with the ability to rapidly port apps from Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains, with funding from [Particle B’s $100m EVM fund](https://blog.crypto.com/particle-b-accelerator-launches-the-cro-evm-fund/) and access to the 10M+ user base of the Crypto.com ecosystem.

#### Cronos on Ethermint

Cronos is powered by [Ethermint](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint), which allows rapid porting of apps & smart contracts from Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains. Cronos base settlement currency will be CRO, the native currency of the Crypto.org Chain.
The Inter Blockchain Communications (IBC) protocol enables interoperability and bridging to the Crypto.org Chain: a fully decentralised, open-source, energy efficient public chain with high speed and extremely low fees. It also allows interoperating with other IBC-enabled chains (e.g., Cosmos Hub).

### Features

**EVM Compatible** - Ethereum developers are used to smart contract capabilities as Ethermint can support any smart contracts, DAOs or Dapps deployed on Ethereum.

**Scalable** - Tendermint can process way more transactions per minute than the EVM, making it faster, cheaper and greener to execute smart contracts.

**Interoperable** - IBC is a protocol that allows blockchains to talk to each other; interoperate and transfer value, interchange assets and services, and connect without running into the scaling issues inherent in some of the largest blockchains today.

**Easy deployment** - Users can follow the deployment instruction to quickly and easily deploy Cronos testnet for their own using purposes.

**Crypto.com ecosystem** - 10 million users + ecosystem

**Crypto.com community Support** - Finance + Audit

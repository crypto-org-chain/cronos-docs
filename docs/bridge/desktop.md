**Step 5**: Await for Bridge confirmation 

After the transfer is initiated, the CRO will be bridged from the Crypto.org Chain to the Cronos Chain. The bridging process typically takes about a few minutes to complete. Once it’s done, you will see an updated balance in your receiving Cronos address.

Additionally, you will be able to view the Transaction in further details by clicking the transaction hash which directs you to the Crypto.org Chain explorer.And you can always review your latest bridge transfer history by clicking the icon at the top-right corner.
